The FOX engine uses a similar setup with hair as other materials,
utilizing a base color map (BSM), a PBR map (SRM) and a
translucency/transmission map (TRM). Some character models will make use
of hair normal maps, but most do not.

The BSM map will have an alpha channel that must be used for
transparency.

As usual, the SRM map is as follows:

  - (Red): Specular Occlusion
  - (Green): Roughness
  - (Blue): Map Mask
