**Zeta** is an [Infinite Heaven](/Infinite_Heaven "wikilink") add-on
that is both an in-game mod manager and modding framework. It was
created to simplify modding, to improve mod organization, and to resolve
file conflicts between mods. It can manage weapons, vehicles, custom
player models, buddies and more. [It's required to use Zeta
modules.](https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsolidvtpp/search/?search_description=Zeta)

    them, change their settings as well as their load order.

    make the modifications you want without overwriting game files.
  - Mod Support: Playable characters, vehicles, buddies, soldiers,
    missions, weapons, items, camos, LUA mods, and more\!
  - Non-Replacer Mods: Mods no longer conflict with one another\! They
    can have their own unique assets without replacing vanilla content.
