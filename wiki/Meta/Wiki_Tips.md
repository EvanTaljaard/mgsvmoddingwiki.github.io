This page covers tips for using the wiki, some of which are non-obvious so worth skimming through even as a savvy user.

## Search

The search box returns results in the form of autocomplete suggestions. As it peforms a full text search it can be little sluggish on Firefox-based browsers. The results can also be navigated using keyboard arrow or tab keys.

There are a number of search operators that can be used to refine queries:

| Operator | Example | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `â€‚` | `inf hook` | Spaces act as an *and*. Strings can be partial and still match. |
| `|` | `hair | sound` | Pipes act as an *or*, returning results of either string. |
| `""` | `"infinite heaven"` | Wrapping in double quotes returns exact match. |
| `!` | `inf heaven !guide` | Prefixing an exclamation mark before a string will exclude results that contain the string. To exclude multiple words wrap the string in double quotes like `!"some term"`. |
| `^` | `^meta` | Returns results beginning with string. |
| `$` | `entries$` | Returns results ending with string. Note: this can match things like tag fields that end with a particular tag. |

> **Tip:** if you still can't find what you're after you can try the [All Pages](/Meta-All_Pages) list, where there's a list of all pages by title and a list of all categories to browse.


## Top toolbar buttons

At the top of every page are a row of icons. This table explains them from left to right.

> **Tip:** for simple, text-only page edits or new pages the Prose.io buttons with the colored backgrounds are the easiest way. It just requires a single authorization with your Github account and then it can handle submissions on your behalf. For more about creating/editing pages see the [Creating/Editing a Page](/Meta-Creating_Editing_a_Page) guide.
