# Sahelanthropus Battle Sequence

On the beginning he follows the player around walking towards him,
firing the miniguns on his head, if he gets close to the player he uses
his amazing flamethrower or even tries to stomp the player if there is
his specific navmesh (.nav2) , otherwise he jumps around the player area
and uses his Archaeal Blade and shoots some missiles from time to time.
(Note: all that happens if you use his navmesh)

After a while an helicopter is called automatically (the Pequod is very
important in the battle), if not, i recommend the player to call 1, on
the UNSA map (test map), the helicopter is stuck on 0 , 0, 0 area, no
idea why that happens

When his health is around 50% he drops an metallic archaea grenade,
Pequod leaves the area automatically and the battle proceeds, all
vehicles and walker gears on the area are now useless.

After some time the red mist disappears, that's when you have to call
Pequod again, the game does that automatically unless you remove that
function from the mission enemy.lua file (i strongly recommend to not do
that, Pequod is important to trigger rex mode)

When his health is around 30-25% Sahelanthropus attacks Pequod, you can
either destroy the missiles and protect Pequod or let him die.

After attacking Pequod, Sahelanthropus jumps to a nearby “Sniping Point”
and triggers the rex mode and his railgun.

After some shots, he goes back to normal and proceeds to attack the
player normally, some time later he jumps to the player and Mantins
appears in  a slowmo style, to avoid getting shot by Sahelanthropus Rail
gun, you need to shoot Mantis, should be floating in front of
Sahelanthropus (i noticed that sometimes Mantis doesn't appear), that
goes on in a loop until you kill him

Notes: He needs to attack Pequod to go Rex mode, no Pequod = no railgun
