# Sahelanthropus Nav2 

.nav2 files are the NPC “navmesh” map navigation files, it makes NPCs able to "see" the terrain and paths for them to use, Sahelanthropus is no diference there. Without this files, Sahelanthropus wont work. Currently there is no way to create new nav2 files but we can edit the existing ones.
