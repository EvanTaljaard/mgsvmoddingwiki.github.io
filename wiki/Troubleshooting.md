\!Problem \!Corrective Action \!Remarks \!Misc Information |- |MGSV:GZ
Crashes upon start up |Check your drivers, make sure they are up to
date. Try removing peripherals and plugging them in once the game has
booted. |Check the system requirements section for this application. |
|- |"MGSV:GZ has stopped working" |If running the game with an AMD
graphics card, check your drivers and update to the [latest
version](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/AMD-Radeon-Software-Crimson-Edition-15.12.aspx).
|Check your system logs and see what events are firing when the game is
crashing, there might be helpful information in there. | |- |Dualshock 4
controller unrecognized |Enter big picture mode for controller support,
Steam will automatically download the supported configurations. |If
config doesn't work
[try](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://ds4windows.com/).
If it still doesn't work could be hardware compatibility issues beyond
the scope of this chart. | |- |GZ Crashes instantly |Multiple solutions

1.  If GeForce experience is installed, disable "Capture/Enhance"

2\. If you're running an Antivirus and start the game the Antivirus will
sometimes quarantine the executable. |Disable the AV, or create an
exception in the settings. | |- |[Game crashes on final
cutscene](https://steamcommunity.com/app/311340/discussions/0/4477100383811384588/)
|"I'm running the game on Ubuntu 18.04. After I clear the first mission
the game either gets stuck or crushes after the screen saying "Will
return in Phantom Pain...".
Tried both with Proton 5.9-GE and 5.13 to no avail. Changing graphics,
going to window mode, etc. doesn't help. Saw some codec solution, but
these are Windows only, I'm not sure if they can even be applied to
Proton.

Did anybody found any useful solution? Maybe editing save file or
somehow modifying cutscene (tried to extract data with Gzs Tool, but
have no idea how to proceed from there?)." |*Solution Unknown* the
application might work better on a Windows OS rather than Linux. Most
definitely running on a 64-bit OS... however, it is not known what kind
of hardware the user has. | |- |Cursor/Mouse Issues "Spinning circle"
|Multiple solutions

1.  Switch from fullscreen to borderless fullscreen.
2.  Create an invisible cursor file and attach it to the loading
    animation

|Messy solutions

1.  I found that if you briefly use the mouse to right-click to aim,
    then start using the controller again, the cursor disappears for a
    few minutes. Hardly ideal, but there you go
2.  Pause it, click the mouse, move the control stick on the controller,
    unpause it, proceed as if nothing happened.
