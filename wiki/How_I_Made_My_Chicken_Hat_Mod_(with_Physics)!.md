### IMPORTANT:

This tutorial assumes you have already unpacked **every .dat file**
located in `Steam/steamapps/common/MGS_TPP/master` into a folder, using
**Archive Unpacker** (you do not have to unpack the .dat files with long
strings of code). After unpacking, use the **Mass Texture Converter** to
have the game's texture files readily available in a folder of your
choosing. Daften_23's video tutorial series is a great place to start,
linked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n4jzXGObPs). It will walk
you through the basics of modding Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain,
from unpacking game files, to messing around with models and textures.

I will probably come back in the future and write out the steps in text,
but for now, I present the video I made a few months back, with -
hopefully - audio you can follow, and understand.
