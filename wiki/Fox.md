The Fox Engine provides the organizational and functional framework atop which the Metal Gear Solid V games are built. The game engine cannot do anything by itself; it exists simply to build games. When the game is packaged for distribution, the game and game engine code become indistinguishabl from one another, which is why there is no separate "FoxEngine.dll" or even another executable aside from mgsvtpp.exe. However, the engine vs. game separation is highly visible in the organization behind the scenes. Fox divides its code into "Modules," which are each loaded by the game and they can also reference each other. For example, **Anim** requires **Gr**, the graphics module, to be loaded first. A list of modules can be seen below:
