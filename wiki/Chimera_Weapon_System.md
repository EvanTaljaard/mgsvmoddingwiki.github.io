What is the Chimera Weapon System, or rather, what is Chimera?

Chimera is the internal name for pretty much everything weapon related
in MGSV, mainly associated with firearms.

The name of it is thanks to how through weapon customization, you're
able to mix and match different weapon parts around, essentially
creating a
[chimera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_\(mythology\)) weapon.
And while the system has it's limitations set by the game, you can
pretty much tinker with each of it's .lua based files to open up more
possibilities, customization options, altering stats and the like.

## Chimera Categories

There are two kinds of chimera weapons:

### True Chimeras

These are weapons that in the base game, the player is allowed to both
use and customize at will.

They're composed of separate models that are put together by the game,
and *only* the player is allowed to use them.

### CS Weapons

These weapons, unlike the previous type, can be used by either the
player or NPC soldiers. Be it those soldiers being Mother Base Staff,
XOF, Soviets, or the various PFs in Africa. The name of the category
comes from certain weapons that have the word "CS" added at the end.

While they still need to use the standard chimera system in the files,
they're composed of one single model. The vast majority of them the
player is only able to find and use them in the field, by stealing it
from NPCs. Some of them however can be used by being equipped in sortie
prep, and have customization options locked up. Weapons such as the
Adam-ska Special and the Tornado-6 Revolver are under this category.
