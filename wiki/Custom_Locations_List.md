Custom / Addon Locations for Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.

See [Locations](/Locations "wikilink") for vanilla locationIds.

Infinite Heaven is required to add them to the game, and requires a
Mission set in the location to use them.

Note for location authors: Due to how the engine uses locationId must be
unique for each mission. So if you are creating locations you should
make sure you don't conflict with existing ones, and update this page
with the ids you intend to use.
