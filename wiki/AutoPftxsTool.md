AutoPftxsTool is an open-source automatic .pftxs unpacker and repacker
for Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain written by BobDoleOwndU. It
simplifies the process of adding new textures or sub-textures to a
.pftxs file as it eliminates the need to edit an .xml with new entries
to do so.

## Usage

To unpack a .pftxs archive, a user simply needs to drag a .pftxs file
onto the tool. This will output a folder containing all of the files
contained in the .pftxs file. To add new textures, a user simply needs
to place the textures inside the unpacked folder. To repack a .pftxs
file, the user simply needs to drag an unpacked folder onto the tool.
The tool will automatically detect all textures contained in the folder
and pack them into a .pftxs file.
