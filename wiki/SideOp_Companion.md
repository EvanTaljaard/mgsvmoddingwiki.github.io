*SideOp Companion* (aka *SOC*) is a program to aid the creation of [custom side-ops](/Custom_Side-Ops_List/) for MGSV. It simplifies much of the tedium of the process and is a recommended gateway to side-op modding.

A full guide and the source code can be found on the [Github site](https://github.com/JosephZoeller/SOC/), while a video guide by the author is embedded below.

> As with custom side-ops in general [Infinite Heaven](/Infinite_Heaven) is also required to be installed.
