FoxKit is a general-purpose Fox Engine data editor, which includes
features such as importing, exporting, and creat new AI routes utilizing
TppRouteSet or Routes. (.[frt](/FRT "wikilink"))

Most existing materials referencing FoxKit concern FoxKit-1, including the following guides. A successor, FoxKit-3 (following a short-lived FoxKit-2 test project), is under active development. To learn more, or to contribute to FoxKit-3's development, please visit our Discord.

FoxKit-1 works by wrapping FoxLib's importers into ScriptedImporters which
is handled automatically by Unity. FoxKit reads the project's directory
structure and mimics the game's directory structure.

Installation procedures and a basic modification tutorial can be
referenced
