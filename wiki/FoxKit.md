FoxKit is a general-purpose Fox Engine data editor, which includes
features such as importing, exporting, and creat new AI routes utilizing
TppRouteSet or "FOX Routes." (.[frt](/FRT "wikilink"))

FoxKit works by wrapping FoxLib's importers into ScriptedImporters which
is handled automatically by Unity. FoxKit reads the project's directory
structure and mimics the game's directory structure.

Installation procedures and a basic modification tutorial can be
referenced

  - [.fmtt](/FMTT "wikilink")
  - .frt
  - .htre
  - .pcsp
