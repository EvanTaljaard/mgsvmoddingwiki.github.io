While a lot of progress has been made in modding MGSV since its release,
there are still some major unsolved problems and mysteries. This page
should serve as an index of major outstanding problems, what's known
about them, and why they're important.

## Missions

### iDroid mission limit

While custom missions are possible, there is a limit to how many
missions can be displayed in the iDroid. it is currently unknown if this
limit exists in the exe or in a UI file.

## Levels

While custom levels appear to be possible in theory, there are a few
major limitations at present.

### Navmeshes

While custom routes would allow you to place soldiers in a custom level,
navmeshes are required to facilitate AI navigation of the map. This file
format (.nav2, .nta) is completely unexplored.
