## Definition

Reverse engineering or "Reversing" is the process of dissecting
artifacts without any reference. Reversing is applicable to most
man-made artifacts, but in the case of game modifications it refers to
extracting meaningful information from executable binary. It should be
noted that reverse engineering and science are nearly identical, what
defines reverse engineering is the study of materials created by man
rather than studying naturally occuring phenomena. To begin reversing a
video game you need to have a basic understanding of low-level software.
